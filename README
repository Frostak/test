Simple console application for packages and fees

Just download included jar file
Run command line and switch to where you download it

To run jar file: java -jar Thread.jar initFile feeFile

optional initFile - providing this will cause application to load initFile.txt with initial load of packages
optional feeFile - providing this will cause application to load feeFile.txt with initial load of fees

writing quit will exit application

unit testing and documentation not included in program of that size (application is pretty simple to understand)

There are many options how to implement.
Also many point should be discussed how should be exactly implemented and much more specified behaviour.
